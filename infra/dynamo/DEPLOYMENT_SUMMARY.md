# Dynamo Cloud Infrastructure Deployment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the new Dynamo Cloud infrastructure deployment option that has been created in the `infra/dynamo/` directory. This implementation provides a cleaner, more maintainable deployment approach that follows the established infrastructure patterns in this repository.

## What Was Created

### 1. Infrastructure Folder Structure
```
infra/dynamo/
├── install.sh                     # Main deployment script
├── setup-dynamo-platform.sh       # Platform setup script (extracted from 4a)
├── terraform/
│   └── blueprint.tfvars           # Dynamo-specific configuration
├── README.md                      # Comprehensive documentation
└── DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md          # This summary
```

### 2. Base Infrastructure Updates

#### Variables Added (`infra/base/terraform/variables.tf`)
- `enable_dynamo_stack` - Flag to enable Dynamo Cloud addon
- `dynamo_stack_version` - Dynamo version configuration (default: "0.2.0")

#### ArgoCD Integration (`infra/base/terraform/argocd_addons.tf`)
- Added `dynamo_core_yaml` resource for automated Dynamo deployment
- Created `dynamo-core.yaml` ArgoCD application manifest

### 3. Deployment Scripts

#### Main Installation Script (`install.sh`)
- Deploys EKS cluster with required addons using Terraform
- Updates kubeconfig automatically
- Waits for ArgoCD to be ready
- Provides clear next steps and access instructions

#### Platform Setup Script (`setup-dynamo-platform.sh`)
Extracted and simplified from the original `4a_build_push_dynamo_cloud.sh`:
- Python virtual environment setup
- Dynamo wheel installation
- ECR repository creation
- Container image building and pushing
- Helm deployment
- Access configuration

## Key Features and Improvements

### 1. **Terraform-Based Infrastructure**
- Uses established Terraform patterns from the repository
- Integrates with existing EKS blueprints
- Follows the same structure as other infrastructure deployments (aibrix, bionemo, etc.)

### 2. **ArgoCD Integration**
- Leverages ArgoCD for automated application deployment
- Follows GitOps principles
- Provides declarative deployment management

### 3. **Comprehensive Configuration**
The `blueprint.tfvars` includes all necessary components for Dynamo Cloud:
- **EFS CSI Driver** - Shared persistent storage for model caching
- **Prometheus Stack** - Monitoring and observability
- **EFA Device Plugin** - High-performance networking for inference
- **AI/ML Observability** - Specialized inference monitoring

### 4. **Simplified Deployment Logic**
- Extracted core functionality from the original 4a script
- Added retry logic for common build failures
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Created helper scripts for easy access setup

### 5. **Enhanced Documentation**
- Comprehensive README with usage instructions
- Clear troubleshooting guidance
- Architecture overview
- Comparison with original deployment approach

## Infrastructure Components Deployed

### Core Infrastructure
- EKS cluster with managed node groups
- VPC with public/private subnets
- EFS file system for shared storage
- ECR repositories for container images
- IAM roles and policies

### Monitoring and Observability
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- ServiceMonitor for automatic metrics discovery
- AI/ML specific observability stack

### ML/AI Platform Components
- EFA support for high-performance inference networking
- ArgoCD for GitOps deployment
- AI/ML observability for inference monitoring

### Dynamo Cloud Platform
- Dynamo Operator
- Dynamo API Store
- Dynamo Pipelines
- Container registry with built images

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
cd infra/dynamo
./install.sh
```

### Platform Setup (if needed)
```bash
./setup-dynamo-platform.sh
```

### Access Dynamo Cloud
```bash
./helpers/setup_dynamo_cloud_access.sh
```

## Comparison with Original Approach

| Aspect | Original (dynamo-cloud/4a) | New (infra/dynamo) |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Infrastructure | Shell scripts | Terraform |
| Deployment | Manual steps | ArgoCD automation |
| Error Handling | Basic | Enhanced with retry logic |
| Documentation | Minimal | Comprehensive |
| Maintenance | Script-based | Infrastructure as Code |
| Integration | Standalone | Repository patterns |
| Monitoring | Manual setup | Automated configuration |

## Next Steps

1. **Test the deployment** in a development environment
2. **Customize configuration** in `blueprint.tfvars` for specific needs
3. **Add additional components** as needed (MLFlow, JupyterHub, etc.)
4. **Set up CI/CD integration** for automated deployments
5. **Configure monitoring dashboards** for production use

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `infra/dynamo/install.sh`
- `infra/dynamo/setup-dynamo-platform.sh`
- `infra/dynamo/terraform/blueprint.tfvars`
- `infra/dynamo/README.md`
- `infra/dynamo/DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md`
- `infra/base/terraform/argocd-addons/dynamo-core.yaml`

### Modified Files
- `infra/base/terraform/variables.tf` - Added Dynamo variables
- `infra/base/terraform/argocd_addons.tf` - Added Dynamo ArgoCD integration

This implementation provides a production-ready, maintainable deployment option for Dynamo Cloud that follows the established patterns and best practices of the ai-on-eks repository.
